# See http://help.github.com/ignore-files/ for more about ignoring files.
#
# If you find yourself ignoring temporary files generated by your text editor
# or operating system, you probably want to add a global ignore instead:
#   git config --global core.excludesfile ~/.gitignore_global

# Ignore bundler config
/.bundle

# Ignore the default SQLite database.
/db/*.sqlite3

# Ignore all logfiles and tempfiles.
/log/*.log

# We actually want /tmp/restart.txt, but not the rest of /tmp
/tmp/*
!/tmp/restart.txt

# We should precompile the assets each time, I think
/public/assets

# We don't want to have the profile pictures publicly available on GitHub
/public/system

# We don't want the database backups being uploaded to GitHub
/sql_db_backup
